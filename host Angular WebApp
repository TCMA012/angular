host Angular WebApp
https://pages.github.com/

If you're just interested in deploying the webapp, you can use any service that lets you publish static websites.

Netlify has already been mentioned and is a great choice (I actually host a couple apps through Netlify). Here is some documentation on Angular + Netlify integration: https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/angular/

You can also use Github Pages or Gitlab Pages if you host your repository on one of these services.

They key here is that Angular builds your app into a bunch of static files. When you push new code to your repository, Netlify/Github/Gitlab will execute the build command to produce these files and deploy them.
